# 1. Create a workflow that includes steps with conditional keywords. For example, run a step only if the previous step succeeded or only if the current branch is main.
# 2. Create a workflow that includes a step with workflow commands to set environment variables, create output parameters, and write to logs.
# 3. Create a workflow that demonstrates the use of dependent jobs. For example, create a workflow with three jobs: build, test, and deploy. The test job should depend
# on the build job, and the deploy job should depend on the test job.
# 4. Create a workflow that triggers on the check_suite event. The workflow should run a series of tests, and if any test fails,
# it should open an issue in the repository with the details of the failure.
